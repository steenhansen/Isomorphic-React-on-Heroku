<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
1909, from the later middle, more sophisticated than <strong>The Night Land</strong>, more tightly plotted than The Boats Of The Glen Carrig, all the letters of H.P. Lovecraft that talk about William Hope Hodgson, revisions to <strong>Supernatural Horror In Literature</strong>, a doomed an haunted ship, terrible sea-devils of quasi-human aspect, latent horrors in nature, &#8220;reaches enviable peaks of power&#8221;, the LibriVox audiobook, not as jam-packed with incident, the Carnacki stories, cosmic vistas, accessibility, a straightforward story, what it was like to being a working sailor, cliques and alliances, tremendous fun, time travel that good literature can give you, the poopiest book of all of Hodgson&#8217;s work, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taffrail">taffrail</a>, mood, a ghostly haunted ship, <strong>From Beyond</strong> by H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood&#8217;s <strong>The Willows</strong>, an intrusion by other forces, shadows, strange figures, disappearances, underwater ships, not just a ghost, predation, dimensional drift, pirate skeletons ghosts don&#8217;t fit, its the ship that&#8217;s haunted, but not only the ship, the ship&#8217;s name is &#8220;Mortzestus&#8221;, &#8220;Sangier&#8221; (the bloodier), &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get my money out of this ship&#8221;, the pay scene in <strong>Aliens</strong> (1979), a thing from outside, bubbling below the surface is the corporatism problem, a commercial venture, mutiny, the officers want it hushed up, writing it up in the log, it is regrettable that Bryan isn&#8217;t here, why Marx wrote his works in England, the relationship between the means of production (the ship) and its sailors, taking care vs. making money, commercial considerations, historical piracy, in the lulls between sea-devils, &#8220;mate&#8221; reminds us of &#8220;comrade&#8221;, we&#8217;re all in this together mate (or comrade), why were there so many pirates?, why piracy happened, a Freudian (or Marxist) reading, the Sindey Sime illustration of <strong>The Ghost Pirates</strong>, &#8220;pale eyes&#8221;, mummified figures, are the ghost pirates a projection of the crew&#8217;s submerged collective unconscious?, the pirate articles, communism and democracy, parallels the Russian Revolution style, the captain, the quartermaster, the hatred that Hodgson had for commercial sailing, spooky, a sub-layer to the tale, the frustrations of the crew, &#8220;that old bully&#8221;, we are in trouble now, the devils take them all, the slang for the ship is &#8220;this packet&#8221;, the crew as a wrapping on the parcel, the language of spiritualism, Jessup&#8217;s theory as to what&#8217;s going on:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve formed a bit of a theory, that seems wise one minute, and cracked the next. Of course, it&#8217;s as likely to be all wrong; but it&#8217;s the only thing that seems to me to fit in with all the beastly things we&#8217;ve had lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea is, that this ship is open to be boarded by those things,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;What they are, of course I don&#8217;t know. They look like men— in lots of ways. But—well, the Lord knows what&#8217;s in the sea. Though we don&#8217;t want to go imagining silly things, of course. And then, again, you know, it seems fat-headed, calling anything silly. That&#8217;s how I keep going, in a sort of blessed circle. I don&#8217;t know a bit whether they&#8217;re flesh and blood, or whether they&#8217;re what we should call ghosts or spirits.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>this ship is &#8220;open&#8221;, what happened on this ship that &#8220;opened it up&#8221;, <strong>The Haunted Jarvee</strong> (a Carnacki story), there&#8217;s something about the ship, there&#8217;s a crack in it, a tear in the fabric of reality, a sitting duck for otherworldly buccaneers, what is the goal of the sea-devils, what are they doing up in the rigging, four ghost ships, aliens?, aliens from the ocean?, are they Doctor Who sea-devils?, are they deep ones?, a parallel reality, <strong>From Beyond</strong>, Crawford Tillinghast is turning up ghosts, vestigial organs, ultra-violet,<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;What do we know,&#8221; he had said, &#8220;of the world and the universe about us? Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature. With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break dawn the barriers.</p></blockquote>
<p>if this was adapted today it would be explained by the cargo, an intra-dimensional material from atomic tests, 1920, <strong>The Dreams In The Witch House</strong>, 1934, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee_Chapter"><strong>The Banshee Chapter</strong></a> (2013), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Beyond_%28film%29"><strong>From Beyond</strong></a> (1986), a Freudian reading, Bill Clinton, in the language of apology, venereal disease, drugs, a found footage film, the framing story, believe it or not, <strong>The Ghost Pirates</strong> would make a great audio drama, showing the figures, crystallizing, Carnacki&#8217;s explanation in <strong>The Haunted Jarvee</strong>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;Well,&#8217; replied Carnacki, &#8216;in my opinion she was a focus. That is a technical term which I can best explain by saying that she possessed the &#8220;attractive vibration&#8221; that is the power to draw to her any psychic waves in the vicinity, much in the way of a medium. The way in which the &#8220;vibration&#8221; is acquired &#8211; to use a technical term again &#8211; is, of course, purely a matter for supposition. She may have developed it during the years, owing to a suitability of conditions or it may have been in her (&#8220;of her&#8221; is a better term) from the very day her keel was laid. I mean the direction in which she lay the condition of the atmosphere, the state of the &#8220;electric tensions,&#8221; the very blows of the hammers and the accidental combining of materials suited to such an end &#8211; all might tend to such a thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>making a magnet by hammering a nail, it&#8217;s not a person, it&#8217;s not something on the ship, it <em>is</em> the ship, electrical technology, a blend of science and the supernatural, <strong>BPRD: Plague Of Frogs</strong>, Mark Turetsky, slaves in chains at the bottom of the sea, a ship on its last voyage, the detritus of previous voyages, a Marxist resentment of the treatment of every crewman brought to the ship, end the of The Willows by Algernon Blackwood, working the same mine of feeling, the preface to the original edition, <strong>The House On The Borderland</strong>, certain conceptions of elemental kinship, flinging open the door wide, a kaleidoscope, scene upon scene, the door is open only a crack, speculation, what was the purpose, four shadowy galleons, the four ships below, are they mirrored (upside-down in the water), visualizing it is shocking, the Red Scare, they&#8217;re going to come here and take what we have, the Spartacus rebellions, an inter-dimensional idea, overwhelmed and pulled down, the other side of the veil, working a different passage in a nether dimension, if Neil Gaiman were to take this book as inspiration&#8230;, the surface of the sea, scraping along the surface of another world, the power of nautical ghost stories is in that liminal space between an ocean of air and an ocean of water, water as a liminal place in folklore, &#8220;where two elements meet strange things may intrude&#8221;, an inverted frog-men version of our world, are the sails like fins?, trade routes, how you portray the shadow ships, invisible would be fun, mirror world beneath the waves, the covers of various editions, skull and crossbones with a cutlass, whatever you see when you see through the eyes of Jessup, a fishy version of the pirate captain, mood effect, what the hell&#8217;s going on with those pig men?, a short novel, extended novellas, &#8220;I AM A NOVEL&#8221;, the Wikipedia entry, the unfinished novel, had Hodgson lived longer&#8230;, <strong>Captain Dang</strong>, the Sargasso Sea, the dawn of the pulp era proper, embracing the 20th century, <strong>The Hog</strong>, a complete collection.</p>

                The SFFaudio Podcast #349 – Jesse and Mr Jim Moon talk about The Ghost Pirates by William Hope Hodgson
                Talked about on today&#8217;s show:
                1909, from the later middle, more sophisticated than The Night Land, more tightly plotted than The Boats Of The Glen Carrig, all the letters of H.P. Lovecraft that talk about William Hope Hodgson, revisions to Supernatural Horror In Literature, a doomed an haunted ship, terrible sea-devils of quasi-human aspect, latent horrors in nature, &#8220;reaches enviable peaks of power&#8221;, the LibriVox audiobook, not as jam-packed with incident, the Carnacki stories, cosmic vistas, accessibility, a straightforward story, what it was like to being a working sailor, cliques and alliances, tremendous fun, time travel that good literature can give you, the poopiest book of all of Hodgson&#8217;s work, the taffrail, mood, a ghostly haunted ship, From Beyond by H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood&#8217;s The Willows, an intrusion by other forces, shadows, strange figures, disappearances, underwater ships, not just a ghost, predation, dimensional drift, pirate skeletons ghosts don&#8217;t fit, its the ship that&#8217;s haunted, but not only the ship, the ship&#8217;s name is &#8220;Mortzestus&#8221;, &#8220;Sangier&#8221; (the bloodier), &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get my money out of this ship&#8221;, the pay scene in Aliens (1979), a thing from outside, bubbling below the surface is the corporatism problem, a commercial venture, mutiny, the officers want it hushed up, writing it up in the log, it is regrettable that Bryan isn&#8217;t here, why Marx wrote his works in England, the relationship between the means of production (the ship) and its sailors, taking care vs. making money, commercial considerations, historical piracy, in the lulls between sea-devils, &#8220;mate&#8221; reminds us of &#8220;comrade&#8221;, we&#8217;re all in this together mate (or comrade), why were there so many pirates?, why piracy happened, a Freudian (or Marxist) reading, the Sindey Sime illustration of The Ghost Pirates, &#8220;pale eyes&#8221;, mummified figures, are the ghost pirates a projection of the crew&#8217;s submerged collective unconscious?, the pirate articles, communism and democracy, parallels the Russian Revolution style, the captain, the quartermaster, the hatred that Hodgson had for commercial sailing, spooky, a sub-layer to the tale, the frustrations of the crew, &#8220;that old bully&#8221;, we are in trouble now, the devils take them all, the slang for the ship is &#8220;this packet&#8221;, the crew as a wrapping on the parcel, the language of spiritualism, Jessup&#8217;s theory as to what&#8217;s going on:
                &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve formed a bit of a theory, that seems wise one minute, and cracked the next. Of course, it&#8217;s as likely to be all wrong; but it&#8217;s the only thing that seems to me to fit in with all the beastly things we&#8217;ve had lately.&#8221;
                &#8220;My idea is, that this ship is open to be boarded by those things,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;What they are, of course I don&#8217;t know. They look like men— in lots of ways. But—well, the Lord knows what&#8217;s in the sea. Though we don&#8217;t want to go imagining silly things, of course. And then, again, you know, it seems fat-headed, calling anything silly. That&#8217;s how I keep going, in a sort of blessed circle. I don&#8217;t know a bit whether they&#8217;re flesh and blood, or whether they&#8217;re what we should call ghosts or spirits.&#8221;
                this ship is &#8220;open&#8221;, what happened on this ship that &#8220;opened it up&#8221;, The Haunted Jarvee (a Carnacki story), there&#8217;s something about the ship, there&#8217;s a crack in it, a tear in the fabric of reality, a sitting duck for otherworldly buccaneers, what is the goal of the sea-devils, what are they doing up in the rigging, four ghost ships, aliens?, aliens from the ocean?, are they Doctor Who sea-devils?, are they deep ones?, a parallel reality, From Bey[...]</itunes:summary>

Dick.</p>
<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
1962, Jesse and Paul&#8217;s first ever Philip K. Dick novel, rush reading, Juliana Frink, the book within the book, <strong>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</strong>, The Book Of Changes, the book that we are within, more like something Olaf Stapledon would write, future histories vs. alternate histories, what the Japanese and Nazis have done, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail_%28novel%29"><strong>For Want Of A Nail</strong> by Robert Sobel</a>, Mexico, a very odd strange alternate history, a textbook from an alternate world, acharacteristic Dick, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich"><strong>The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich</strong></a>, jewelry, taken from his life, Anne Dick, a soul wrenching scene, soul churning horrific embarrassing, working retail, R. Childan is horrible, he&#8217;s a monster, the least Philip K. Dick book, not a lot of boobs (but still some), not that much coffee, why this book is so powerful, we are so close to the characters souls, sympathy, who is the main character of this book?, Juliana, R. Childan, Mr. Baynes, Frank, Mr. Tagomi, so little interaction between the characters, we don&#8217;t know it is Frank, a clever move, everybody is fake, R. Childan is not Robert Childan, he speech pattern and thought pattern are Japanese, a lack of pronouns, Dick is a chameleon, Paul and Betty, the authentic American experience, soaking up, that&#8217;s not their names, Paul and Betty Kasura are more American than the American, Juliana is a fake judo instructor, she uses a knife, Hawthorne Abendsen, we know where he lives, Hawthorne Abendsen is Robert A. Heinlein for Dick (and Dick himself), children, Heinlein&#8217;s house in Colorado, Heinlein had loaned Dick money, Dick owed money to the IRS, <strong>We Can Build You</strong>, &#8220;To Robert and Ginny Heinlein&#8230;&#8221;, Wyoming, Dick is buried in Colorado, Fort Morgan, Colorado, Riverside Cemetery, damn, Dick&#8217;s sister, mom and dad, D.C., agrarian agronomy?, California, the dedication, &#8220;To my wife Anne, without whose silence&#8230;&#8221;, the jewelry business, getting excited, a bit sulky and a little bitter, a line from Childan&#8217;s mind, this sounds like its true,<br />
<blockquote>They’re out of their minds, Childan said to himself. Example: they won’t help a hurt man up from the gutter due to the obligation it imposes. What do you call that? I say that’s typical; just what you’d expect from a race that when told to duplicate a British destroyer managed even to copy the patches on the boiler as well as—</p></blockquote>
<p>the stamp on the boiler &#8220;Made in Aberdeen&#8221; or whatever, is this a true fact?, the objects, the pistol, Ed and Frank, the fake pistols are real pistols, the two lighters, Roosevelt&#8217;s lighter, historicity, historically interesting, the provenance, superstition of historicity, the real McCoy, you feel it, if Mr. Tagomi&#8217;s civil war era replica revolver can do the job&#8230;, Dick&#8217;s theme for the whole book, the theme that he&#8217;s always engaging, this stuff, actual facts of history, these events happened, the answer in this particular case&#8230;, historific truth, afraid to ask the question, this truth about the world, strangely meta-fictional, Tagomi escapes the meta-fictional world, a true and genuine object, the real state of affairs, cars and the freeway, our world is a nightmare, a depressing two world Cold War between the U.S. and England, C.M. Kornbluth&#8217;s <strong>Two Dooms</strong>, set in the 1940s, a future where the U.S. has lost the war, an alternate broken U.S., captured by the Germans, secret Jewish magical power, the world if we don&#8217;t is too terrible to contemplate, a repeated scene (or feeling), Mr. Baynes on the rocket, from Europe to San Fransisco, Lotze,&#8221;Oh, yes; that&#8217;s so. But racially, you&#8217;re quite close. For all intents and purposes the same.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Lotze began to stir around in his seat, getting ready to unfasten the elaborate belts.</p>
<p>Am I racially kin to this man? Baynes wondered. So closely so that for all intents and purposes it is the same? Then it is in me, too, the psychotic streak. A psychotic world we live in. The madmen are in power. How long have we known this? Faced this? And-how many of us do know it? Not Lotze. Perhaps if you know you are insane then you are not insane. Or you are becoming sane, finally. Waking up. I suppose only a few are aware of all this. Isolated persons here and there. But the broad masses&#8230; what do they think? All these hundreds of thousands in this city, here. Do they imagine that they live in a sane world? Or do they guess, glimpse, the truth&#8230; ?</p>
<p>But, he thought, what does it mean, insane ? A legal definition. What do I mean? I feel it, see it, but what is it?</p>
<p>He thought, It is something they do, something they are. It is-their unconsciousness. Their lack of knowledge about others. Their not being aware of what they do to others, the destruction they have caused and are causing. No, he thought. That isn&#8217;t it, I don&#8217;t know; I sense it, intuit it. But-they are purposely cruel &#8230; is that it? No. God, he thought. I can&#8217;t find it, make it clear. Do they ignore parts of reality? Yes. But it is more. It is their plans. Yes, their plans. The conquering of the planets. Something frenzied and demented, as was their conquering of Africa, and before that, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Their view; it is cosmic. Not of a man here, a child there, but air abstraction: race, land. Volk. Land. Blut. Ehre. Not of honorable men but of Ehre itself, honor; the abstract is real, the actual is invisible to them. Die G?e , but not good men, this good man. It is their sense of space and time. They see through the here, the now, into the vast black deep beyond, the unchanging. And that is fatal to life. Because eventually there will be no life; there was once only the dust particles in space, the hot hydrogen gases, nothing more, and it will come again. This is an interval, ein Augenblick . The cosmic process is hurrying on, crushing life back into the granite and methane; the wheel turns for all life. It is all temporary. And they-these madmen-respond to the granite, the dust, the longing of the inanimate; they want to aid Natur.</p></blockquote>
<p>he is a fucking Nazi!, at this point in the book&#8230;, he says he&#8217;s Jewish, is he Jewish?, a character is introduced.. the become who they really are, Joe Cinadella is an Italian who becomes an SS Aryan assassin, he&#8217;s becoming something, his genuine self, he&#8217;s actually an Italian who changes into a Nazi, transformation not revelation, Joe tells us about his family, what kind of music he like, an elaborate provenance?, Jesse thinks that Dick didn&#8217;t know who Joe was when he began writing, he became what he was in the book and world, Mr. Baynes is transformed, they actually are that way as well, the playing out of reality is undetermined, particle-wave duality, a &#8220;waveicle&#8221;, when you measure him a certain way, the truth is &#8220;revealed&#8221; collapsing the wavefront, observation determines the reality, the characters are in superposition state until Dick cast the yarrow stalks, when the world does it, Baynes is a Swede and a Jew and a Nazi, his elaborate cover, all of the characters are like that, Abendsen deflects, &#8220;I just murdered a man for you&#8221;, it happened to Heinlein, he&#8217;s almost inviting it, everybody knows his address, why does the SS send a Nazi hitman to kill this guy?, that&#8217;s not how they work, why is he telling Mr. Tagomi?, a stalking horse, Tagomi is a chess pawn, the most humane person, when Tagomi defies the German ambassador, the guy he frees is the guy who created the object, karmic circularity, changing as they are perceived, Nazism factionalized, a lot of technical terms, Dick did a lot of reading, the Abwehr, the SD, layers of terminology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, basically Hitler did a shitty job, draining the Mediterranean, skulls for cups, a sequel would have to be set in the Nazi part of things, sensitive and sympathetic, Speer, &#8220;yes he did slave labor, but he didn&#8217;t enjoy it.&#8221;, the two completed chapters of the proposed sequel, Herman Goering, Admiral Canaris, that sounds like a Dick novel (and a role playing game), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Infinite_Worlds">GURPS Infinite Worlds</a>, spreading Nazism to other worlds, staying in the heads of all these Nazis all the time, Heydrich sent Joe, Lotze is also an SD agent, everything is fake with a secret inside, internecine-Nazi?, the pilot for the Amazon series, it almost has no connection to the book, it&#8217;s about that piece of jewelry, it&#8217;s not a book it&#8217;s a movie, for the TV series, Paul&#8217;s guess&#8230; Abendsen has a portal to our world, sign Paul up, a little bit too fluffy and light, the <strong>Minority Report</strong> TV show is a trainwreck, you can&#8217;t really adapt this book, in development for a long time, Ridley Scott, a late-70s <strong>I, Claudius</strong> version shot on videotape, as soon as you start looking at what this book is actually about&#8230;, the American antiques thing is missing, Philip K. Dick reviewing his own novel, like a pair of glasses, what the book does to us, Paul&#8217;s speech about the pin, seeing into Childan&#8217;s head, they all laughed, this crappy play, what a monster you are, he&#8217;s been made a fool, false hopes dashed, Jesse replaces the words &#8220;pin or object&#8221; with &#8220;fiction or novel&#8221; and thus find&#8217;s Dick&#8217;s review of <strong>The Man In The High Castle</strong> within <strong>The Man In The High Castle</strong>, mere content deprived of form, it somehow partakes of tao, this novel has made its peace with the universe, this book has wu, by contemplating it we gain more wu ourselves, since we last about PKD, stones rejected by the builder, a rusty beer can by the side of the road, I have pondered this novel unceasingly, isn&#8217;t that exactly what he&#8217;s doing here?, it doesn&#8217;t have form, so true, Jesse thinks Dick was wrong, Dick almost never did anything like a sequel, think about how Hawthorne Abensen, this is Dick&#8217;s first real success, &#8220;give us more of the same&#8221; (the book industry as we know it), &#8220;I&#8217;m not sad&#8221;, <strong>The Ganymede Takeover</strong> by Philip K. Dick and Ray Faraday Nelson, formless and amorphous, this plotting gels so well, the <strong>I, Ching</strong> helped him, <strong>A Scanner Darkly</strong>, taken from life, a writer who is pretending to be a criminal, an organic shape, &#8220;what&#8217;s really going on here?&#8221;, she&#8217;s saying it right here, when Joe comes back with that haircut, at the heart of this novel, the two real action scenes, when Juliana is with Joe, he is sane and she is the opposite, she goes into the bathroom to kill herself, casting those yarrow stalks, Juliana&#8217;s last decision she makes, <strong>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</strong> Ecclesiastes 12:5, &#8220;and the grasshopper shall be a burden&#8221;, a tiny little thing will have a great weight, the title of the book itself, why is the book called &#8220;The Man In The High Castle&#8221;?, the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnham's_Freehold"><strong>Farnham&#8217;s Freehold</strong></a>, &#8220;barbed wire and machine guns&#8221;, a meditative smile, he&#8217;s lying, he&#8217;s going to sit down when he meets Christ, it sounds like Heinlein, Juliana is literal minded and can&#8217;t understand Abensen&#8217;s jokes, are her boobs real?, she&#8217;s in post traumatic shock, the hymn,<br />
<blockquote>Let us love our God supremely,<br />
Let us love each other too;<br />
Let us love and pray for sinners,<br />
Till our God makes all things new<br />
Then he&#8217;ll call us home to heaven,<br />
At his table we&#8217;ll sit down.<br />
Christ will gird himself and serve us<br />
With sweet manna all around.</p></blockquote>
<p>they never lived in a high castle, Abensen is fated to what will happen, this happened to Robert A. Heinlein, <strong>Stranger In A Strange Land</strong>, Popular Mechanics showed Heinlein&#8217;s house, a kid&#8217;s bicycle in the driveway, Dick gave Heinlein a kid, Heinlein tried to treat everyone with respect, for Heinlein every race is worthy, weird ideas about sex and gender, an equal rights for all races, equal dignity, the Vietnam War, when hippies start showing up on his door, just like when Juliana shows up, when Juliana calls, they don&#8217;t call the police and kick her out, pilgrims to Dick&#8217;s house, &#8220;he wants me to go to his house and say hi&#8221;, before you do that&#8230;, just to stand there and feel the historicity, where he came to rest, the final gloss, a fake high castle, the high castle is the skull, who is the man in the high castle?, the mind trapped within the skull looking out, Dick was never satisfied, zoology and philosophy, Plato&#8217;s Myth of the Cave, chained to the floor since birth, behind them are people carrying various objects on their heads and walking by, and behind them are fires, the believe the shadows on the wall are the real world, if one should manage to escape&#8230;, they wouldn&#8217;t believe, Juliana says I&#8217;m one of the few, Baynes says it too, what&#8217;s the TRUTH about this world, in fact it&#8217;s only me when writing this book, unlike Lovecraft or Poe, the intertextual thing going on, written by Heinlein or Pohl (or Kornbluth), peak performance of this particular feeling, this is the PKD book you can hand to anybody who has read a little bit of history, as the facts unfold, even that reality is fake, the George Guidall narration, the little prologue, that recording is from 1997, audiobooks at that time, the traditional market (for audiobooks) was the blind, a standard trope that has disappeared now, the back of the dust-jacket, a singular mark of American literature, an amazing book, re-reading it, so many layers, we&#8217;re done.</p>

                The SFFaudio Podcast #347 – Jesse, Paul, and Marissa talk about The Man In The High Castle by Philip K. Dick.
                Talked about on today&#8217;s show:
                1962, Jesse and Paul&#8217;s first ever Philip K. Dick novel, rush reading, Juliana Frink, the book within the book, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, The Book Of Changes, the book that we are within, more like something Olaf Stapledon would write, future histories vs. alternate histories, what the Japanese and Nazis have done, For Want Of A Nail by Robert Sobel, Mexico, a very odd strange alternate history, a textbook from an alternate world, acharacteristic Dick, The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich, jewelry, taken from his life, Anne Dick, a soul wrenching scene, soul churning horrific embarrassing, working retail, R. Childan is horrible, he&#8217;s a monster, the least Philip K. Dick book, not a lot of boobs (but still some), not that much coffee, why this book is so powerful, we are so close to the characters souls, sympathy, who is the main character of this book?, Juliana, R. Childan, Mr. Baynes, Frank, Mr. Tagomi, so little interaction between the characters, we don&#8217;t know it is Frank, a clever move, everybody is fake, R. Childan is not Robert Childan, he speech pattern and thought pattern are Japanese, a lack of pronouns, Dick is a chameleon, Paul and Betty, the authentic American experience, soaking up, that&#8217;s not their names, Paul and Betty Kasura are more American than the American, Juliana is a fake judo instructor, she uses a knife, Hawthorne Abendsen, we know where he lives, Hawthorne Abendsen is Robert A. Heinlein for Dick (and Dick himself), children, Heinlein&#8217;s house in Colorado, Heinlein had loaned Dick money, Dick owed money to the IRS, We Can Build You, &#8220;To Robert and Ginny Heinlein&#8230;&#8221;, Wyoming, Dick is buried in Colorado, Fort Morgan, Colorado, Riverside Cemetery, damn, Dick&#8217;s sister, mom and dad, D.C., agrarian agronomy?, California, the dedication, &#8220;To my wife Anne, without whose silence&#8230;&#8221;, the jewelry business, getting excited, a bit sulky and a little bitter, a line from Childan&#8217;s mind, this sounds like its true,
                They’re out of their minds, Childan said to himself. Example: they won’t help a hurt man up from the gutter due to the obligation it imposes. What do you call that? I say that’s typical; just what you’d expect from a race that when told to duplicate a British destroyer managed even to copy the patches on the boiler as well as—
                the stamp on the boiler &#8220;Made in Aberdeen&#8221; or whatever, is this a true fact?, the objects, the pistol, Ed and Frank, the fake pistols are real pistols, the two lighters, Roosevelt&#8217;s lighter, historicity, historically interesting, the provenance, superstition of historicity, the real McCoy, you feel it, if Mr. Tagomi&#8217;s civil war era replica revolver can do the job&#8230;, Dick&#8217;s theme for the whole book, the theme that he&#8217;s always engaging, this stuff, actual facts of history, these events happened, the answer in this particular case&#8230;, historific truth, afraid to ask the question, this truth about the world, strangely meta-fictional, Tagomi escapes the meta-fictional world, a true and genuine object, the real state of affairs, cars and the freeway, our world is a nightmare, a depressing two world Cold War between the U.S. and England, C.M. Kornbluth&#8217;s Two Dooms, set in the 1940s, a future where the U.S. has lost the war, an alternate broken U.S., captured by the Germans, secret Jewish magical power, the world if we don&#8217;t is too terrible to contemplate, a repeated scene (or feeling), Mr. Baynes on the rocket, from Europe to San Fransisco, Lotze,&#8221;Oh, yes; that&#8217;s so. But racially, you&#8217;re quite close. For all intents and purposes the same.&#8221;
                Lotze began to stir around in his seat, getting ready to unfasten the elaborate belts.
                Am I racially kin to this man? Baynes wondered. So closely so that[...]</itunes:summary>

Dick.</p>
<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />

<blockquote>
    It is hard not to write Satire. For who is so tolerant<br />
    of the unjust City, so steeled, that he can restrain himself&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>Pathic men that pretend to be moral exemplars are much worse than those who are open about their proclivities.</p></blockquote>
<p>he&#8217;s talking about Republicans, the &#8220;wide stance&#8221;, puritanism, strider -> Streiter, making choices, that&#8217;s what this book is about, just wing it, self-assured hubris, &#8220;he&#8217;s an idea, not a man&#8221;.</p>

Rabkin</a> talk about the <strong>Star Maker</strong> by Olaf Stapledon.</p>
<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
1937, Jesse has a radical thesis, is this book a true story?, I&#8217;m not really happy I just think that I am, <strong>Alice In Acidland</strong>, drugs, what do we mean by true?, arachnoids and ikthyoids, a summary of <strong>Last And First Men</strong>, the unnamed narrator, astral projection, the contents of this book, not history but a personal experience (of imagination), standing on a hill, an interesting fantasia, considering the size of the universe, <strong>Star Trek</strong> with Nazi costumes is possible and perhaps even inevitable, <strong>The Truman Show</strong>, the nature of infinity, an Italian who would be perfectly happy to use the word true about this book, &#8220;Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark.&#8221;, bitterness, Dante Alighieri, a lyric poem, Olaf Stapledon was a philosopher, a blazing panoply, an image of the rose, OS, &#8220;One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill.&#8221;, an abiding faith, the original meaning of comedy, comedies end in marriage, sitcoms, both narrators acknowledge their psychological state, an exponential rhythm, overhead obscurities in flight, a Doppler shift, the other Earth, Bvalltu, a composite character, planets &#8211; > solar systems -> galaxies, a fractal experience, an encompassing wisdom, marriage as a small atom of community, spirit inhabited rock, a World War I novel, 1986, Eric taught <strong>Star Maker</strong> to Bryan, memories imbricated upon each other, the preface, Stapledon was an ambulance driver in WWI, looming WWII, militarism, seeing the sunny side of a ruined planet, Merseyside, too smashed up to really be alive, a 1930s novel, fascism vs. communism, how to organize the self and society, a secular myth, a shock to civilization, the cycle of mechanization, terrible mutations, the onset of the tank, a sense of horror, WWI and WWII as two different episodes, the Spanish Civil War, shaking off colonialism, materialistic industrialization, the only wait out is an act of faith, how can we not think of the Star Maker as a monster, &#8220;struck dumb with shame&#8221;, limitations of the audio medium, Bryan&#8217;s keyboard, C.S. Lewis, why C.S. Lewis didn&#8217;t like <strong>Star Maker</strong>, a Lewis-nemesis, crusades, the Great War on Terror (2 decades old), mindless religious violence, anticipations of subsequent Science Fiction, <strong>The High Crusade</strong> by Poul Anderson, two 20th century philosophies, Freud and Marx, neurosis and sublimation, genitals with sense organs, radio pornography, the feelies from <strong>Brave New World</strong>, crisis of labour, ideologies as philosophical artifacts, not Dave Singer, separated by space and time, supplementary parentheses, adduction of Christianity, three linked universes, playing for the souls of the creatures, a timeless heaven and a timeless hell, Earth, Mars, and Venus in C.S. Lewis&#8217; Space Trilogy, suffering for the redemption of the Earth, explicitly not a Christian view, C.S. Lewis&#8217; Space Trilogy as a response to a paragraph in <strong>Star Maker</strong>, all the Christs of all the worlds, &#8220;a basket of Christs&#8221;, this is Arthur C. Clarke, a tour of Science Fiction in the future, this is <strong>The Mote In God&#8217;s Eye</strong>, <strong>The High Crusade</strong>, the novel itself is a universe, cosmos vs. universe, Jesse&#8217;s theory about the <strong>Game Of Thrones</strong> universe in the TV show, what Clarke does this in slight watercolours Stapledon paints in bold oils on a massive canvas, Arthur C. Clarke&#8217;s life changing moment, copying out the scales of magnitude, Bryan&#8217;s son, encapsulating, it <em>is</em> Stapledon, Dante is Dante in <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong>, <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> as political revenge, Niven and Pournelle&#8217;s <strong>Inferno</strong>, Stapledon is not a punishment guy, when Lovecraft looks out of the universe&#8230;, when Stapledon looks at the same vista he&#8217;s not as melancholy about it, <strong>The Cats Of Ulthar</strong>, contemporaries, philosophical horror, long distance psychology, like Poe, fairy tales, handling fears, we get to feel, this is an education effort, quite special, a genre issue, the roller-coaster moment, looking at the vocabulary, eldritch and ichor, lucidity, feeling, the etymology of the word &#8220;vermin&#8221;,<br />
<blockquote>I reflected that not one of the visible features of this celestial and<br />
living gem revealed the presence of man. Displayed before me, though<br />
invisible, were some of the most congested centers of human population.<br />
There below me lay huge industrial regions, blackening the air with<br />
smoke. Yet all this thronging life and humanly momentous enterprise had<br />
made no mark whatever on the features of the planet. From this high<br />
look-out the Earth would have appeared no different before the dawn of<br />
man. No visiting angel, or explorer from another planet, could have<br />
guessed that this bland orb teemed with vermin, with world-mastering,<br />
self-torturing, incipiently angelic beasts.</p></blockquote>
<p>the stellar wars, too lucid for more tribal patterns, sympsychic partnership, angelic vermin, more real than all the stars, like two close trees grown together, difference can be strength, the Orson Welles radio version of <strong>The War Of The Worlds</strong>, versus the Martians our differences don&#8217;t make a hill&#8217;s worth of difference, <strong>The Lord Of The Rings</strong>, looking for the Ents and the Entwives, there are Ents in <strong>Star Maker</strong>, the holy sex transmission that never got off, the ships worlds,<br />
<blockquote>It was a strange experience to enter the mind of an intelligent ship to<br />
see the foam circling under one&#8217;s own nose as the vessel plunged through<br />
the waves, to taste the bitter or delicious currents streaming past<br />
one&#8217;s flanks, to feel the pressure of air on the sails as one beat up<br />
against the breeze, to hear beneath the water-line the rush and murmur<br />
of distant shoals of fishes, and indeed actually to hear the<br />
sea-bottom&#8217;s configuration by means of the echoes that it cast up to the<br />
under-water ears. It was strange and terrifying to be caught in a<br />
hurricane, to feel the masts straining and the sails threatening to<br />
split, while the hull was battered by the small but furious waves of<br />
that massive planet. It was strange, too, to watch other great living<br />
ships, as they plowed their way, heeled over, adjusted the set of their<br />
yellow or russet sails to the wind&#8217;s variations; and very strange it was<br />
to realize that these were not man-made objects but themselves conscious<br />
and purposeful.</p>
<p>Sometimes we saw two of the living ships fighting, tearing at one<br />
another&#8217;s sails with snake-like tentacles, stabbing at one another&#8217;s<br />
soft &#8220;decks&#8221; with metal knives, or at a distance firing at one another<br />
with cannon. Bewildering and delightful it was to feel in the presence<br />
of a slim female clipper the longing for contact, and to carry out with<br />
her on the high seas the tacking and yawing, the piratical pursuit and<br />
overhauling, the delicate, fleeting caress of tentacles, which formed<br />
the love-play of this race. Strange, to come up alongside, close-hauled,<br />
grapple her to one&#8217;s flank, and board her with sexual invasion. It was<br />
charming, too, to see a mother ship attended by her children. I should<br />
mention, by the way, that at birth the young were launched from the<br />
mother&#8217;s decks like little boats, one from the port side, one from the<br />
starboard. Thenceforth they were suckled at her flanks. In play they<br />
swam about her like ducklings, or spread their immature sails. In rough<br />
weather and for long voyaging they were taken aboard. At the time of our<br />
visit natural sails were beginning to be aided by a power unit and<br />
propeller which were fixed to the stern.</p></blockquote>
<p>nothing like this in Science Fiction, Lloyd Abbey&#8217;s <strong>The Last Whales</strong>, an elegiac book, another sub-genre of Kindle based pornography, much of William Wordsworth&#8217;s poetry is admired too simply, Eric reads <strong>Lines Composed Upon Westminster Bridge</strong>, the houses with windows like sleeping eyes, watching the lives of dreams, the houses are sleeping not the people within them, the smokeless air, lying still, what makes the beauty, <strong>The World Is Too Much With Us</strong>, a cry for God, Fungi From Yuggoth (IX): <strong>The Courtyard</strong> by H.P. Lovecraft:<br />
<blockquote>It was the city I had known before;<br />
The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngs<br />
Chant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongs<br />
In crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore.<br />
The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at me<br />
From where they leaned, drunk and half-animate,<br />
As edging through the filth I passed the gate<br />
To the black courtyard where the man would be.</p>
<p>The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursed<br />
That ever I had come to such a den,<br />
When suddenly a score of windows burst<br />
Into wild light, and swarmed with dancing men:<br />
Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead—<br />
And not a corpse had either hands or head!</p></blockquote>

                1937, Jesse has a radical thesis, is this book a true story?, I&#8217;m not really happy I just think that I am, Alice In Acidland, drugs, what do we mean by true?, arachnoids and ikthyoids, a summary of Last And First Men, the unnamed narrator, astral projection, the contents of this book, not history but a personal experience (of imagination), standing on a hill, an interesting fantasia, considering the size of the universe, Star Trek with Nazi costumes is possible and perhaps even inevitable, The Truman Show, the nature of infinity, an Italian who would be perfectly happy to use the word true about this book, &#8220;Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark.&#8221;, bitterness, Dante Alighieri, a lyric poem, Olaf Stapledon was a philosopher, a blazing panoply, an image of the rose, OS, &#8220;One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill.&#8221;, an abiding faith, the original meaning of comedy, comedies end in marriage, sitcoms, both narrators acknowledge their psychological state, an exponential rhythm, overhead obscurities in flight, a Doppler shift, the other Earth, Bvalltu, a composite character, planets &#8211; &#62; solar systems -&#62; galaxies, a fractal experience, an encompassing wisdom, marriage as a small atom of community, spirit inhabited rock, a World War I novel, 1986, Eric taught Star Maker to Bryan, memories imbricated upon each other, the preface, Stapledon was an ambulance driver in WWI, looming WWII, militarism, seeing the sunny side of a ruined planet, Merseyside, too smashed up to really be alive, a 1930s novel, fascism vs. communism, how to organize the self and society, a secular myth, a shock to civilization, the cycle of mechanization, terrible mutations, the onset of the tank, a sense of horror, WWI and WWII as two different episodes, the Spanish Civil War, shaking off colonialism, materialistic industrialization, the only wait out is an act of faith, how can we not think of the Star Maker as a monster, &#8220;struck dumb with shame&#8221;, limitations of the audio medium, Bryan&#8217;s keyboard, C.S. Lewis, why C.S. Lewis didn&#8217;t like Star Maker, a Lewis-nemesis, crusades, the Great War on Terror (2 decades old), mindless religious violence, anticipations of subsequent Science Fiction, The High Crusade by Poul Anderson, two 20th century philosophies, Freud and Marx, neurosis and sublimation, genitals with sense organs, radio pornography, the feelies from Brave New World, crisis of labour, ideologies as philosophical artifacts, not Dave Singer, separated by space and time, supplementary parentheses, adduction of Christianity, three linked universes, playing for the souls of the creatures, a timeless heaven and a timeless hell, Earth, Mars, and Venus in C.S.

1960 novel, 1956 novella, the Goddreads reviews, Reddit, re-listening, very visual, John Mcclane at the end of <strong>Die Hard</strong>, conference room scenes, vague characters, awesome ideas, three Philip K. Dick stories that could have inspired The Terminator movies, no time travel, Doctor Futurity, Skynet, the drones (the hammers), UAV style drones vs. terminators, drone technology, there were drones in WWII, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_unmanned_aerial_vehicles">remote controlled bombers</a> [ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aphrodite">Operation Aphrodite</a>], almost nothing &#8220;invented in SF&#8221; was actually invented in SF, infiltrators, Jesse has become a <strong>Terminator</strong> geek, <strong>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</strong>, Screamers (adapted from Second Variety by Philip K. Dick), two battling computers, humans as pawns, both computers are in the same building!, proxies, the Internet is missing, Vulcan 3 is building the Internet, Skynet&#8217;s drones, Skynet doesn&#8217;t have central control, when Vulcan 3 is controlled, Vulcan 3 as a baby, creepy, at the periphery of the plot, the education sub-theme, a little red headed girl, being raised by a terminator, such a fanny show, the movies are recycling scene and catchphrases, at the school, a non-conformist school, Philip K. Dick&#8217;s kid is in school, regular school crushes creativity, meritocracy, nepotism, an unfinished thought, cronyism, technocratic government, getting through by hard work, was he an A.I. controlled by Vulcan 3, &#8220;hey the system works!&#8221;, sociological ideas, how un-Dickian this novel is, a relatively straightforward mystery, no weird obsessions (like with infidelity), the obligatory black haired girl, the president of the world comes into the world takes a little girl out of school and takes her home?, WTF?, the teacher&#8217;s okay with this?, the classroom, the concentration camp in Atlanta is a psychology camp, the conformist world in <strong>A Wrinkle In Time</strong>, Marissa learns Science Fiction, a planet of complete conformism, &#8220;you let them play an unstructured game?&#8221;, stifling of independent thought and creativity, why was the teacher killed?, reading <strong>Lolita</strong>, secretly reading forbidden books, is Philip K. Dick improving the books when he re-writes them (consensus is NO), two cults, a cult of reason and rationality, why is that rebellion group called the &#8220;Healers&#8221;, like alternative medicine, the worship of the computer, Greys, blue collars against the white collars, &#8220;we shouldn&#8217;t undervalue people just because their skills are in their hands and in their fingers&#8221;, vaxxers vs. the anti-vaxxers, back to <strong>Dr. Futurity</strong>, Vulcan 2 in the novella, piecing Vulcan 2 back together like a damaged hard-drive, the data is recovered aurally, listening to the broken thoughts of Vulcan 2, not just white noise in between the broken sentences, a groaning of ghosts, psychology, weird and interesting, absolutely NOT what anyone else does in Science Fiction, the Butlerian Jihad, because&#8230; Skynet, nobody says actually technology is really quite useful, 43% of the Earth&#8217;s resources?, the paragraph, maintaining the computer, the &#8220;lesser order of human needs&#8221;, some sort of metaphor 43 percent of calories go to the brain?, a biological parallel, making the decisions, making the policy, a subtle allusion to Plato, the greys the technician class are &#8220;guardians&#8221;, denying a brain data (big mistake), <strong>The Just City</strong> by Jo Walton, Athena sets up Plato&#8217;s <strong>Republic</strong>, automatons for physical labour, seeing the connections, <strong>The Republic</strong>, Socrates, like the old Atlanteans, the Gold the Silver and the Bronze (ditch diggers and truck drivers), the Silver (the police, functionaries, tax-collectors), the Gold (the enlightened, the philosophers), Vulcan 3 is the Gold, the T-class (experts and specialists), these books are all being suppressed (due to copyright), a pretty good title, Hammer shaped robots?, Vulcan (aka Hephaestus), the ancient Greeks and Romans, Hephaestus built a robot for Athena, the Greeks were really into automata, metal beings, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos">Talos of Crete</a>, Vulcan as the wizard of metal, a Philip K. Dick conference lecture, when the Greeks thought of gods they thought of A.I. (sort of), these atoms over here have desires, intelligence in non-living things, a little bit under cooked, what about Vulcan 1?, or does it?, maybe Vulcan 1 is hiding, in a degenerate state, <strong>Deus Irae</strong> and <strong>The Last C.</strong>, tactical nukes, a lot of weakness but it makes up for it, a bit of paranoia, that&#8217;s usually what causes the problem, self-preservation, when Saddam Hussein is threatened, the emotional computer, pleading only as a human could do, &#8220;We can come to an arrangement!&#8221;, shades of <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong>, <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> is a microcosmic version of <strong>Vulcan&#8217;s Hammer</strong>, several <strong>Star Trek</strong> episodes, <strong>The Ultimate Computer</strong>, <strong>Star Trek</strong> as a metaphor for American foreign policy, <strong>The Apple</strong>, they kill the computer that regulates their society, they killed the snake but&#8230;, vegetarians are now hunting, put some controls on this, as a metaphor for society, a rebellion against pain in the body, the mind as the government, living in a post-WWIII world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames"><strong>WarGames</strong></a>, the Russians had a battle computer called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand_%28nuclear_war%29">The Dead Hand</a>&#8220;, a dead-man&#8217;s trigger, WWIII was looming in 1956 and 1960, so good even though its not that good, Dick loves blue collar workers, Father Fields, making something out of the air-conditioner, a dropped thread, a completely weird metaphor, <strong>The Borderlands</strong> series, <a href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Scooter">Scooter</a>, a technopath, <strong>The Variable Man</strong> by Philip K. Dick, &#8220;he fixed things&#8221;, a great tagline, &#8220;I don&#8217;t got Philip K. Dick for action&#8221;, living in a disposable society, everything is disposable, is there a TV-repair shop left in North America?, modern cars, only 5.5 hours, zoning out, cool predictions, the paranoid artificial intelligence, Sam Harris and Joe Rogan, caging an A.I., setting up honey-traps, Jesse thinks that&#8217;s not going to be the issue, <strong>Neuromancer</strong> all A.I.&#8217;s have digital shotguns strapped to their heads, &#8220;the smartest man in the world&#8221;, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, worries, better as a metaphor than as a prediction, we shouldn&#8217;t be unconcerned, <strong>Colossus: The Forbin Project</strong>, it isn&#8217;t 1s and 0s on a screen, seeing inside a burned diary, <strong>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</strong> by Robert A. Heinlein, Mike the computer (aka Mycroft Homles), what&#8217;s missing from <strong>Vulcan&#8217;s 3</strong>&#8216;s life is a friend, kids want to know, I think you guys are liars if&#8230;, kids are going to get into everything and that&#8217;s not a bad thing, more information is better, Vulcan 2&#8217;s decision, Occupy, Black Lives Matter, you are totally welcome to prosper if you are willing and able to play a certain kind of game, the push-back is caused by the masses rejecting stability, the adventurer class, &#8220;more concerned with gain than with stability&#8221;, the phrases: &#8220;life is cheap&#8221;, big gambles, the Netflix series <strong>Narcos</strong>, communist guerrillas living in the jungle, if you are living in a corrupt society you get a lot of gamblers, the striking opening scene, &#8220;can&#8217;t you get a better picture?&#8221;, they all wear the uniform of their class, another theme, destroying stability, going back to entropy, it is kind of Philip K. Dickian after-all, undercooked or maybe overcooked, the same with <strong>Time Pawn</strong>, this is my worst book, Dean Koontz&#8217;s 1973 novel of <strong>Demon Seed</strong> has a rapey robot computer, with the rewrite of <strong>Demon Seed</strong> Koontz has mellowed out, writing for the market, even after his death, <strong>Puttering About In A Small World</strong> by Philip K. Dick, everything&#8217;s always better with a robot wife.</p>

                Talked about on today&#8217;s show: Published 60 years ago; research is Jesse&#8217;s &#8220;security blanket&#8221;; The Black Stone by Robert E. Howard; stone of Erech has parallels to the Kaaba in Mecca; Moses&#8217;s ill-fated water-rock in Old Testament; the Stone of Scone; palantíri; War? What is it good for? We aren&#8217;t fans of all the battles; Éomer&#8217;s poetic &#8220;all is lost&#8221; moment; The Last Samurai and heroic fatalism; World War I; Faramir&#8217;s dislike of war; the movies&#8217; over-reliance on spectacle; the power of words; the Lord of the Nazgûl; Éowyn&#8217;s badassery; Houses of Lamentation vs. Houses of Healing; the strength of the weakest; parallels between Merry and Pippin; the flaws of film versions of Éowyn&#8211;and Faramir; great deeds vs. duty; Éowyn as Old Norse valkyrie archetype; the twisting of the Nazgûl; debating the corporeality of Sauron; Sauron and Denethor use others for their dirty work; Ghân-buri-Ghân and other marginalized figures; woodwoses; no authorized Lord of the Rings fan fiction; Jesse wants public domain story following Gimil and Legolas on postwar adventures; Fifty Shades of Grey as Twilight fanfiction; Tolkien&#8217;s scholarly inside jokes; we don&#8217;t know our Greek numbers; on foils, parallels, and the integrity of Tolkien&#8217;s work; Théoden and Denethor; Gandalf&#8217;s healing power, &#8220;see the light&#8221;; Denethor&#8217;s false wisdom; Denethor passages have quality of a Greek tragedy; modern society, like Denethor, can&#8217;t see the whole picture; film portrayal of Gandalf whacking Denethor is not canon; Christ parallels and the resurrection of hope; the layering of symbolism; barrow wights and Théoden&#8217;s barrow; Korean harvest festival Chuseok; the aggression of the Tolkien estate; the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings animated movies of yore; &#8220;the hands of the king are the hands of a healer&#8221;; athelas (kings foil) to the rescue!; the king&#8217;s power to call the wounded back from the dead; the title of lore master; the last big distraction and self-sacrifice at the Black Gate; on the division of Lord of the Rings into books and volumes; on the pleasures of slow reading; more discourse on Denethor; Pippin and Merry are interchangeable (!?); even Sauron is just one evil power, parallels cyclical historical events in our world (cf. resurgence of Russia under Putin); no spoilers for Maissa!; the Mouth of Sauron&#8217;s terms, and what if Gandalf had surrendered?; Hitler, appeasement, and Alexander the Great; envisioning flamethrower guitarist from Mad Max: Fury Road at the Battle of the Black Gate;

<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
Book 4, from The Taming Of Smeagol to the end of <strong>The Two Towers</strong>, or &#8220;Don&#8217;t get tangled-up with a spider&#8221;, or &#8220;Frodo slogging through the marshes forever&#8221;, or &#8220;nothing but a bunch of people walking&#8221;, Jesse&#8217;s least favorite, so gloomy, poems, flora, fauna, stew, Julie thinks it&#8217;s necessary, encounters, the overall gloom, the purification of Frodo, also Sam, carry-on and finish-off, Sam as the hero, Sam telling the story, Sam is the lowest of the low, the evolution of Sam, Sam is jealous of Gollum, Jesse loves the meta-stuff, &#8220;Mr Frodo, sir&#8221;, Smeagol must save them both, once upon a time, &#8220;Tell me more about Sam, dad.&#8221;, the huge elf warrior, Gollum&#8217;s story, we&#8217;re never the villain, what inspired Richard K. Morgan&#8217;s <strong>The Steel Remains</strong>, seeing it from the orcs&#8217; point of view, how well structured, looking forward and looking back, nuanced and multi-layered, Tolkien&#8217;s reputation, a very black and white moral sensibility&#8230;, the other point of view, the creation of orcs, Melkor, one of the seven gods of Middle Earth, the blight of Mordor, the flowers on the crown, dark and light, Frodo and Gollum, old and beautiful vs. old and pitiable, they could have been each other, the argument between Gollum and himself, the editing, why is Gollum bad, stinker and slinker, Sam&#8217;s apology to Smeagol, Smeagol is passive aggressive, the timing as the greatest tragedy of the whole book, Cory Olsen, the lost opportunity, twisting the promise, what the ring has promised him, Gollum the great could eat fish three times a day!, his modest dreams, like a dog off a leash, he&#8217;s like a dog in every way, guilty dogs, dogs turning on their masters, fish are sweet to Gollum, everything that we like he hates, calling Gandalf&#8217;s words to mind, the big picture, the eye is looking for you, Smeagol&#8217;s contribution, even the worst evil, chance if chance you call it, diverting evil to good, the deal with Faramir, another structural thing, three travelers in a land, Riders Of Rohan, who be you, it is totally a mirror, Aragorn and crew, revealing vs. being discovered, the righteous, blindfolded again, a foreshadowing of Éowyn, well the Rohirrim are great but&#8230;, bear that in mind, Faramir&#8217;s mind reading power, who are the Númenóreans?, Jesse thinks it is wisdom, not so much about race, it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s full of lore, the mind reading thing, Galadriel&#8217;s telepathy, &#8220;No&#8221;, &#8220;come hither&#8221;, ESP?, character vs. race, country first (Borimir) vs. wisdom first (Faramir),<br />
<blockquote>I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.</p></blockquote>
<p>this is the guy, the BBC radio drama, you ran all the way to me!?, Tolkien is teasing us, an echo of Galadriel, grey eyes glinting, not if I found it on the highway, &#8220;It&#8217;s not a romance novel, Julie.&#8221;, &#8220;Wow, what a guy!&#8221;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wenham">David Wenham</a>, Aragorn is a ranger of the North and Faramir is a ranger of the South, Sam&#8217;s oliphant, what false promises did Sauron make to these guys?, dressed like Robin Hood and the merry men of Sherwood, one of the most religious things in <strong>The Lord Of The Rings</strong>, a meeting in the secret lair, Sam&#8217;s overspeaking reflecting Frodo&#8217;s overspeaking back in the Prancing Pony, heart over head, another geographical reflection, behind a waterfall, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm's_Deep">Helm&#8217;s Deep</a>, seeing Rohan, seeing the storm, the dark skies, Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul, the chapter titles, The Passage Of The Marshes, The Black Gate Is Closed, Of Herbs And Stewed Rabbit, ruin the conies, the homely things, pots and pans, the phial of Galadriel, the Checkov&#8217;s shotguns, the belt that Borimir was given, the magic items, used once, Hobbits learn to cook before they speak, the rope!, Shelob stings Frodo like when Frodo is stung by the morgul blade back at Weathertop, running blindly on the bridge, Cirith Ungol, Shelob is Ungoliant&#8217;s daughter, the children of Shelob inhabit Mirkwood, South African spiders, how many time has the ring been worn?, Bilbo at the party, Frodo at the Prancing Pony, Frodo at Weathertop, Frodo at Amon Hen, Frodo at Borimir&#8217;s confrontation, Sam at Shelob&#8217;s lair, the ring&#8217;s effect on Sam, different people are effected differently by the ring, Frodo&#8217;s power with the ring would be to command, the ring is like a computer, if you think google is the internet&#8230;, the ring gives invisibility as a basic power, it gives Sam the power of sharp hearing and translation, Frodo can see more, Sam&#8217;s superpower is listening (he was an eavesdropper), as they approach Mordor the ring gets heavier and more powerful, leap from a precipice into a fire, it also blinds Frodo, the ring&#8217;s perception, &#8220;the master&#8217;s back&#8221;, because it is linked to Sauron, like a dog?, back to the magic items, if you play Dungeons and Dragons, a bow of plus to killing orcs, even Borimir&#8217;s gift, Sam&#8217;s dirt, Frodo&#8217;s phial, Sting from Frodo to Sam, leaving the Mithril armor, and then there&#8217;s the rope, the tying of the rope, is it a magic rope?, Galadriel&#8217;s rope?, that&#8217;s not her gift, words have power, another manifestation, &#8220;We got rope&#8221; [says some random elf], cloaks, rope, and bread, who is following?, is Gollum really allergic to the rope, if somebody tied me up, he can&#8217;t eat the lembas, he hates light, the ropes, and the nice things, climbing down Dracula-style, he knows his knots, the mystery from the previous, what happened to the entwives?, back in the Green Dragon Inn, &#8220;oh those tales&#8221;, the Ents tell where the Entwives went, the Brown Lands are brown, Jesse found a thread somewhere on the internet, Teleporno, a lot of digital ink was spilled, the last paragraph of page 258, just after watching the storm, &#8220;the skirt of the storm&#8221;, primed for finding the entwives, looking at Fanghorn,<br />
<blockquote>At last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer precipice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, Sam,&#8221; said Frodo. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what it leads to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nasty drop, I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; said Sam.</p>
<p>The cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliff&#8217;s brink. The bottom of the gully, which lay along the edge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down. When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out.</p></blockquote>
<p>ties it too a stump, got this rope from the elves, oh I don&#8217;t want it elf rope behind, the rope is not magic, not really high fantasy, the birch stump untied the rope!, the last of the entwives, Frodo and Sam aren&#8217;t looking out for the entwives, &#8220;10 points for creativity&#8221;, a structural argument, they untie their bonds and sit down on a stump, answering any and every question, Julie goes with Tolkien&#8217;s answer, Jesse argues for the book over the author, here&#8217;s proof that the entwives are there, every time Galadriel&#8217;s name gets mentioned, the last thing he says is Galadriel and he strokes the rope, there is no truth of the matter, we cannot go to Middle Earth except by reading this book, Jesse keeps marshaling the argument, &#8220;you will find friends&#8221;, &#8220;Elrond is right&#8221;, two hobbits sit down on a stump and are taken by a tree, on the edge of a forest, symmetrically it works, an undefeatable argument unless, if were trying to solve mysteries&#8230;, the fragrant area, it used to be, this place had its history too before it was the Brown Lands, there are things we don&#8217;t know and things Tolkien didn&#8217;t know about it, world-build the hell out of it, structurally: the time, a three day foot journey to the west and a three day foot journey to the east, near simultaneous action, the end of page 70, even the wind is mapped out, Emun Myul, &#8220;almost felt you liked the place?&#8221;, a magic talking tree, the final nail in the coffin, the birch, the word book comes from the word birch, bravo bravo, the mystery is left there, when we were talking about the word stuff, Tom Bombadil,<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;It&#8217;s a trap!&#8217; said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. &#8216;I wish old Tom was near us now!&#8217; he thought. Then as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart, it seemed to him that he saw&#8230; a light in his mind, almost unbearably bright at first&#8230;. Far off&#8230; he saw the Lady Galadriel&#8230; in Lórien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, Ring-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear, for you I have prepared this.</p></blockquote>
<p>and that happens again, Sam brings light by thought, the big theme, with this phial, brandishing this light, intolerable light, unbearable light, the infection of light, Frodo asleep becoming a phial of light, Sam seeing it in Frodo, Frodo fading?, Frodo purified?, light going through him, the pincushion effect!, Frodo the white, the trend of weariness, the fate of all the elves, <a href="http://mythgard.org/academy/">Mythgard Academy</a>, that&#8217;s a choice, The Choices Of Master Samwise, you noodle!, everything that happens in the last book, foolish choices (wise choices), signing a contract you haven&#8217;t read, who would have the ring now?, somebody cut this open, the orcs had orders, in the floaty ghosty of the eye, the black hand only has four fingers, does Sauron have a body?, rolling Frodo into a ditch, all my choices have proved ill, what good lay in choice?, the very last map in <strong>The Two Towers</strong>, the wetwang and the entwash, Rohan, the new book <strong>The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings: J.R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams</strong> by Philip and Carol Zaleski, telling the story of The Inklings, Lewis&#8217; atheism and conversion, intertextuality, reading each other&#8217;s minds, Eagle And Child pub, Hugo Dyson, an alternate theory on the entwives, the vocal mannerisms of treebeard are those of C.S. Lewis, the question is not: &#8220;where are the entwives&#8221; but rather &#8220;where are our husbands?&#8221;, Dorothy L. Sayers, a male exclusive club, christian apologetics, a shoo–in.</p>

Lovecraft; read by Mr Jim Moon. This is an unabridged reading of the story (1 hour 23 minutes) followed by a discussion of it. Participants in the discussion include Jesse, Seth, and Mr Jim Moon.</p>
<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
a Science Fiction, Horror, or Fantasy story?, hard to classify, <strong>Idle Days On The Yann</strong> by Lord Dunsany, wistful elements, <strong>The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</strong>, a spiritual or psychological analog, a long prose poem, describing lands that never were, a lovely little tale, narrative isn&#8217;t exactly the point, the bird, the bird as an eidolon of the ship, the eidolon Lathi, <a href="http://mockman.com/">Jason Thompson</a>&#8216;s comic adaptation of <strong>The White Ship</strong>, the ghost ship, why is the bird blue?, over the cataract, falls as if it wasn&#8217;t going to, the world ending, a description of Cathuria, aloe and sandalwood, an imagined land, dreaming Cathuria into existence, the sacred river Narg, Kublai Khan, a dream snatched away and smashed, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe, <strong>Dream-Land</strong> by Edgar Allan Poe,<br />
<blockquote>By a route obscure and lonely,<br />
Haunted by ill angels only,<br />
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,<br />
On a black throne reigns upright,<br />
I have reached these lands but newly<br />
From an ultimate dim Thule—<br />
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,<br />
       Out of SPACE—Out of TIME. </p></blockquote>
<p>Lathi and Thalarion, <strong>Celephais</strong>, <strong>The Dream Quest Of Unknown Kadath</strong>, an old dreamer and lighthouse keeper of Kingsport town, fewer and fewer ships, a great delusional fugue state, a white spar and a blue bird, <strong>Polaris</strong>, a watchman in a watchtower, a beautiful symmetry, structural similarity, a beautiful dead woman, <strong>Eleonora</strong>, <strong>Ligeia</strong>, <strong>Morella</strong>, un-whimsical, <strong>Hypnos</strong>, the bearded mentors, astral projected journey, going to far, moon-beams, <strong>The Moon-Bog</strong>, a bridge of moon-beams, big ancient cities, civilization, you can&#8217;t have books without cities, lore x 3, he was given many books in his youth, when he was young and filled with wonder, Thanatos the Greek god of death, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathoth">the throne of Azathoth</a>, a dream of falling, the sin, Randolph Carter is seeking in the dreamlands, where the gods dwell, the gods have conquered, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_from_Porlock">the person from Porlock</a>, Jeff Vandermeer&#8217;s dream, William Hope Hodgson, fungal growths,<br />
<blockquote>Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: “This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Valley Of Unrest</strong> by Edgar Allan Poe,<br />
<blockquote>Once it smiled a silent dell<br />
Where the people did not dwell;<br />
They had gone unto the wars,<br />
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,<br />
Nightly, from their azure towers,<br />
To keep watch above the flowers,<br />
In the midst of which all day<br />
The red sun-light lazily lay.<br />
Now each visitor shall confess<br />
The sad valley’s restlessness.<br />
Nothing there is motionless—<br />
Nothing save the airs that brood<br />
Over the magic solitude.<br />
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees<br />
That palpitate like the chill seas<br />
Around the misty Hebrides!<br />
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven<br />
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven<br />
Uneasily, from morn till even,<br />
Over the violets there that lie<br />
In myriad types of the human eye—<br />
Over the lilies there that wave<br />
And weep above a nameless grave!<br />
They wave:—from out their fragrant tops<br />
External dews come down in drops.<br />
They weep:—from off their delicate stems<br />
Perennial tears descend in gems.</p></blockquote>
<p>what the heck does that mean?, nameless things that feast upon the corpses of men, a large layer of death, allegorical symbolism, the platonic forms,<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;On the green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver, where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grotto-born river Narg.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>what good writing!, Fungi From Yuggoth XVIII: <strong>Gardens Of Yin</strong><br />
<blockquote>Beyond that wall, whose ancient masonry<br />
Reached almost to the sky in moss-thick towers,<br />
There would be terraced gardens, rich with flowers,<br />
And flutter of bird and butterfly and bee.<br />
There would be walks, and bridges arching over<br />
Warm lotos-pools reflecting temple eaves,<br />
And cherry-trees with delicate boughs and leaves<br />
Against a pink sky where the herons hover.</p>
<p>All would be there, for had not old dreams flung<br />
Open the gate to that stone-lanterned maze<br />
Where drowsy streams spin out their winding ways,<br />
Trailed by green vines from bending branches hung?<br />
I hurried—but when the wall rose, grim and great,<br />
I found there was no longer any gate.</p></blockquote>
<p>verse for birthday cards, <strong>The Haunted Lake</strong>, Christmas poems, a concordance of themes, all the shades of Lovecraft, <strong>The Picture In The House</strong>, <strong>The Bells</strong>, <strong>The Shadow Over Innsmouth</strong>, the discover of sanity blasting horrors, ebbs and flows, soul and sanity loss, cosmic transcendence, drawing what we see,<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Basil Elton&#8217;s sin, distant whispers, really?, better than Sona-Nyl?, &#8220;Dude you&#8217;ve always lived alone!&#8221;, a sea-faring Tyler Durduen, a Coleridgian-Obi-Wan Kenobi, a big eastern theme, fantastical oriental places, like Narnia, Arabia mythologized, a marked contrast, Lovecraft as a homebody in the center of a great American port, like living in Atlanta and never getting on an airplane, <strong>Citizen Of The Galaxy</strong> by Robert A. Heinlein, wherever you go, there you are, an interesting visualization, <strong>Celephais</strong>, writing down dreams, a penniless tramp, travels tell me, King Kuranes, his spirit lives on in the dreamlands, scented monsters, the basalt pillars of the west, Jason And The Argonauts, the Pillars of Hercules, Gibraltar, DC Comics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalarion">Thalarion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themyscira_%28DC_Comics%29">Themyscira</a>, <strong>The H.P. Lovecrafts</strong>&#8216; song <strong>The White Ship</strong>, late-sixties hippies and beatniks, wow these are AMAZING!, J.R.R. Tolkien.</p>

<p>The SFFaudio Podcast #319 – Jesse, Julie Davis, Seth, and Maissa continue their journey through <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> by J.R.R. Tolkien with a discussion of Book III “The Treason of Isengard” (aka the first half of <strong>The Two Towers</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</span><br />
<strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> was published in three volumes instead of six volumes due to paper shortages; surprise, Jesse prefers shorter volumes; Ayn Rand&#8217;s thick books, and thin books like <strong>Anthem</strong>; pocket editions of <strong>The Hobbit</strong>; small books make us feel like giant <strong>Alice in Wonder</strong> characters; <strong>The Two Towers</strong> is the shortest volume, though <strong>Return of the King</strong> is bulked up by appendices; as a first-time reader, Maissa appreciated the quick pacing; Anthony Boucher&#8217;s review claims the volume makes &#8220;inordinate demands&#8221; on readers; overwhelming back history; the difference of reading review and reading for pleasure; reading at Shadowfax speed!; &#8220;hope is in speed&#8221;; the poetry of Tolkien&#8217;s prose; Anglo-Saxon influence on alliteration in Rohan speech; the beauty of Tolkien&#8217;s descriptions; Gimli&#8217;s descriptions of the caves; the illegitimate heirs of Tolkien can&#8217;t compete with Tolkien&#8217;s command of language; the Orcs as comic relief; three factions of Orcs set against the three races of runners; Legolas and Gimli working through their differences; evil by definition does not make alliances; Saruman&#8217;s cloak of many colors as a symbol of evil; the Orcs&#8217; lack of coöperation; who is the wandering old man in the hat?; the contrast between the Orc draught and Ent draught, similar to Gandalf&#8217;s flask of Miruvor in Book II; the persistent symbolism of waters and drinking in this volume; similarities between Rohan and Anglo Saxon culture; linguistic parallels between the speech of the Rohirrim and Old English; &#8220;sister-daughter&#8221; and different familial relations in Rohan; the emerging importance of Éowyn; the underpopulation of Middle Earth; parallels between the Third Age of Middle Earth and Europe after the &#8220;fall&#8221; of Rome; Gondor = Rome to some Tolkien scholars; Dan Carlin&#8217;s <strong>Blueprint for Armageddon</strong> on World War I; the influence of World War I on Tolkien&#8217;s writing; flood and trench imagery of Orthanc recalls the devastation of World War I; Middle Earth (and the modern world) is in a time of transition; conversation with Éomer about the persistence of legends; &#8220;not we, but those who come after, will make the legends of our time&#8221;; people tend not to recognize they&#8217;re in a time of transition; Jesse deftly defines &#8220;Flotsam and Jetsam&#8221; for us and ties them into the book&#8217;s backward-looking and forward-looking symbolism; Tolkien&#8217;s love of etymology; action like the Ents&#8217; storming of Isengard happens off-stage; Agatha Christie style foreshadowing with Longbottom Leaf; we don&#8217;t really care about Helm&#8217;s Deep; &#8220;Aragorn joined Éomer in the van&#8221;; <strong>horrible tree puns</strong>; Old Forest as the Fangorn of the West; we&#8217;re pretty sure the Entwives are hanging out there; the Elves are less interesting than Ents because the Elves are too perfect; the Elves talked the Ents into wakefulness; Shadowfax&#8217;s race of horses can understand the speech of men; the pre-speech age of human beings and Koko the gorilla; the Rangers are the detectives of Middle Earth; Voltaire&#8217;s <strong>Zadie and Poe&#8217;s C. Auguste Dupin from The Murders in the Rue Morgue</strong>; debate about existence of evidence for the Entwines&#8211;stay tuned to the next volume!; finding the Entwives = Mission Impossible (cue theme); the growth (in many ways) of Merry and Pippin; Gandalf&#8217;s foresight in allowing them to join the Fellowship; &#8220;they are the pebbles that began the avalanche of the Ents&#8217; rising&#8221;; the three runners sped 220 kilometers in four days; it proved fortuitous that Pippin found the Palantir; the Palantir is FaceTime with Sauron; Merry and Pippin were key to Boromir&#8217;s redemption; return of the black swans&#8211;and the eagle!; Ariel in <strong>The Tempest</strong> by Shakespeare does all the work for Prospero, just like the eagles; Gandalf actually performs magic in &#8220;The Voice of Saruman&#8221; chapter; the voice in <strong>Dune</strong>; Gandalf takes over the council of wizards; the blue wizards aren&#8217;t present because they&#8217;re too &#8220;swear-y&#8221;; the recurring importance of choice; Tolkien is always on the side of free will; Aragorn&#8217;s decision not to follow Frodo; Palantir are the &#8220;seven stones&#8221; of Gondor&#8217;s flag; the Palantir is neither good nor evil; Palantir symbolizes communication of superpowers between the world wars, and the iconic red phone; <strong>The Victorian Internet</strong> by Tom Standee: the telegraph is the best thing since sliced bread; the lazy visual shortcuts that the movie takes with the Palantir and with Saruman&#8217;s influence on Théoden; <strong>The Man Who Never Was</strong>; meanwhile, Sam and Frodo are slogging through; the inevitable breaking of the Fellowship; the four elements in Gandalf&#8217;s death and resurrection; more Lovecraftian weirdness in the bowels of Middle Earth; Gandalf has changed; Norse worm gnawing at the roots of the World Tree; Treebeard as shepherd of the trees; &#8220;boom, boom, dahrar!; Net names tell the whole story of things; Freebeard&#8217;s bed isn&#8217;t for sleeping; Shakespeare&#8217;s disappointment at Shakespeare&#8217;s sleight-of-hand with the trees of Birnam Wood not actually coming to life in <strong>Macbeth</strong>; &#8220;fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane&#8221; almost perfectly echoed in <strong>The Two Towers</strong>; nobody does Elves better than Tolkien; the joy Tolkien must have had writing about trees.</p>

                Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes instead of six volumes due to paper shortages; surprise, Jesse prefers shorter volumes; Ayn Rand&#8217;s thick books, and thin books like Anthem; pocket editions of The Hobbit; small books make us feel like giant Alice in Wonder characters; The Two Towers is the shortest volume, though Return of the King is bulked up by appendices; as a first-time reader, Maissa appreciated the quick pacing; Anthony Boucher&#8217;s review claims the volume makes &#8220;inordinate demands&#8221; on readers; overwhelming back history; the difference of reading review and reading for pleasure; reading at Shadowfax speed!; &#8220;hope is in speed&#8221;; the poetry of Tolkien&#8217;s prose; Anglo-Saxon influence on alliteration in Rohan speech; the beauty of Tolkien&#8217;s descriptions; Gimli&#8217;s descriptions of the caves; the illegitimate heirs of Tolkien can&#8217;t compete with Tolkien&#8217;s command of language; the Orcs as comic relief; three factions of Orcs set against the three races of runners; Legolas and Gimli working through their differences; evil by definition does not make alliances; Saruman&#8217;s cloak of many colors as a symbol of evil; the Orcs&#8217; lack of coöperation; who is the wandering old man in the hat?; the contrast between the Orc draught and Ent draught, similar to Gandalf&#8217;s flask of Miruvor in Book II; the persistent symbolism of waters and drinking in this volume; similarities between Rohan and Anglo Saxon culture; linguistic parallels between the speech of the Rohirrim and Old English; &#8220;sister-daughter&#8221; and different familial relations in Rohan; the emerging importance of Éowyn; the underpopulation of Middle Earth; parallels between the Third Age of Middle Earth and Europe after the &#8220;fall&#8221; of Rome; Gondor = Rome to some Tolkien scholars; Dan Carlin&#8217;s Blueprint for Armageddon on World War I; the influence of World War I on Tolkien&#8217;s writing; flood and trench imagery of Orthanc recalls the devastation of World War I; Middle Earth (and the modern world) is in a time of transition; conversation with Éomer about the persistence of legends; &#8220;not we, but those who come after, will make the legends of our time&#8221;; people tend not to recognize they&#8217;re in a time of transition; Jesse deftly defines &#8220;Flotsam and Jetsam&#8221; for us and ties them into the book&#8217;s backward-looking and forward-looking symbolism; Tolkien&#8217;s love of etymology; action like the Ents&#8217; storming of Isengard happens off-stage; Agatha Christie style foreshadowing with Longbottom Leaf; we don&#8217;t really care about Helm&#8217;s Deep; &#8220;Aragorn joined Éomer in the van&#8221;; horrible tree puns; Old Forest as the Fangorn of the West; we&#8217;re pretty sure the Entwives are hanging out there; the Elves are less interesting than Ents because the Elves are too perfect; the Elves talked the Ents into wakefulness; Shadowfax&#8217;s race of horses can understand the speech of men; the pre-speech age of human beings and Koko the gorilla; the Rangers are the detectives of Middle Earth; Voltaire&#8217;s Zadie and Poe&#8217;s C. Auguste Dupin from The Murders in the Rue Morgue; debate about existence of evidence for the Entwines&#8211;stay tuned to the next volume!; finding the Entwives = Mission Impossible (cue theme); the growth (in many ways) of Merry and Pippin; Gandalf&#8217;s foresight in allowing them to join the Fellowship; &#8220;they are the pebbles that began the avalanche of the Ents&#8217; rising&#8221;; the three runners sped 220 kilometers in four days; it proved fortuitous that Pippin found the Palantir; the Palantir is FaceTime with Sau[...]</itunes:summary>

Dick; read by <a href="http://www.mikevendetti.com/">Mike Vendetti</a>. This is an unabridged reading of the story (1 hour 15 minutes) followed by a discussion of it. Participants in the discussion include Jesse, Tamahome, Paul, and Mike.</p>
<p><u>Talked about on today&#8217;s show:</u><br />
1954, <strong>The God Who Runs</strong>, bad titles, <strong>Next</strong>, Homo Aureus, <strong>The Man In The high Castle</strong> (TV series), hashtag marketing, an episode of <strong>The Twilight Zone</strong>, the film adaptation, <strong>Knowing</strong>, a working train-wreck, the main character has no sapience, autism, the diner scene, not just an exposition scene, the fake salesman, a lady with 8 boobs, shades of <strong>Total Recall</strong>, he&#8217;s looking for Jews, the secret police, the DCA are the secret police, the locals protect the mutant, Philip K. Dick:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Here I am saying that mutants are dangerous to us ordinaries, a view which John W. Campbell, Jr. deplored. We were supposed to view them as our leaders. But I always felt uneasy as to how they would view us. I mean, maybe they wouldn&#8217;t want to lead us. Maybe from their super-evolved lofty level we wouldn&#8217;t seem worth leading. Anyhow, even if they agreed to lead us, I felt uneasy as where we would wind up going. It might have something to do with buildings marked SHOWERS but which really weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>what we did to the neanderthals, this is super X-Men, the John W. Campbell mutants vs. the Philip K. Dick mutants, <strong>House Of M</strong>, for those who are not Tamahome&#8230;, Spider-Man trying to &#8220;pass&#8221; as a mutant, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Witch">Scarlet Witch</a> can re-write reality, to the beginnings of the superhuman genre, the origins of <strong>Superman</strong>, powerful superheroes are going to save us, Astounding -> Analog, John W. Campbell was obsesses with psychic powers being a science, mutation as evolution up, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slan"><strong>Slan</strong></a> by A.E. van Vogt, &#8220;fans are slans&#8221;, a lot of stuff going on, looking into the future, this so isn&#8217;t a movie, they just put a golden tint on the film-stock for <strong>Next</strong>, single word titles, Audible ratings, a story that is repulsive to everybody, we are the monsters, Audible&#8217;s return policy, Mike grew up in the Cold War era, Mutual Assured Destruction, no real external threat anymore, the Soviets have their own DCA, all the &#8220;deves&#8221; are getting &#8220;euthed&#8221;, Cris Johnson is the character&#8217;s name in the book and the movie, Dick was really interested in what happened in Nazi Germany, the atomic war caused all these mutations, the diner scene again, they&#8217;re everywhere!, the Johnson family seem to love Cris, he&#8217;s got the James Bond gene, women can&#8217;t resist, the unfaithful wives (and husbands), the crappy Wikipedia summary, can they sterilize everybody, they know this is the end, Cris can never be outmaneuvered, the whole last 40 minutes of <strong>Next</strong> didn&#8217;t happen, the movie does a good job of illustrating how Cris&#8217; super-power would work, <strong>Groundhog Day</strong>, computer save gaming, because Cris can&#8217;t talk&#8230;, how we interact with NPCs in computer games is how Cris is interacting with everyone around him, we&#8217;re all sort of trapped like that, marketing it as a X-Men or superhero type story, imaging a dollhouse and all the different possibilities he could do, Philip K. Dick is Mr. Innovative, a chilling world that&#8217;s pretty much like ours, a very &#8217;50s feel in terms of the country and random energy shields, the X-Men explanation for mutation (atomic bomb testing), <strong>The Crawlers</strong> by Philip K. Dick, the golden man is beautiful and the crawlers are ugly, the crawlers have their own agenda, they are not seen as human, Harlan Ellison, a mutant psionic, <strong>The Skull</strong> by Philip K. Dick, &#8220;we met the enemy and he is us&#8221;, the mutant theme has dried up in SF, <strong>Deus Irae</strong>, an armless and legless hero, Tibor McMasters, a huge sense of pathos, &#8220;how come people are such assholes&#8221;, <strong>The Turning Wheel</strong> by Philip K. Dick, <strong>White Man&#8217;s Burden</strong>, what if we would have lost the war (WWII)?, Cañon City, Colorado, Mike is the man in <strong>The Man In The high Castle</strong> again, Nazis vs. Imperial Japan, the American occupation of Japan, <strong>Two Dooms</strong> by C.M. Kornbluth, occultist, even more surreal than Dick, we&#8217;re number 1 and their number 10, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werwolf">the werewolves</a> (post-war German resistance against occupation), going to the movies, after the atom bomb, you never saw the Hollywood movie where the Americans invade Russia (the reverse of <strong>Red Dawn</strong>), the ridiculous premise behind the remake of <strong>Red Dawn</strong>, North Korea, auto-immune disease, the acronym-itis that sinks the ship, government conspiracies, aliens, Mexicans are aliens?, what?, what would happen if the Americans left California, don&#8217;t spread that rumor, <strong>Pacific Edge</strong>, the California drought, Washington and Oregon, archetypical Dick, <strong>A Canticle For Leibowitz</strong> by Walter M. Miller, to quote <strong>Solaris</strong>, Dick is wise, if humans go on as Cris Johnson, this is why people are upset that their kids are autistic, he is in a sense &#8220;superior&#8221;, ok you say you want a superior being&#8230; how do you like that John W. Campbell, he&#8217;s a golden god, the Steve McQueen of mutants, a swelling torrent of sheer force!, are they having sex?, cigarettes as symbols, explicit sex, a seduction, is she going to be the mother of dragons?, Genghis Khan style, Cris is unique (for now), dumb feral cubs, dominant or recessive, there is no hope, it won&#8217;t be us, grinning wryly, <strong>In The Mouth Of Madness</strong>, every species can smell its distinction, man will be a myth, one perfectly adapted animal, more of a threat to the men than it is to the women, <strong>Species</strong>, a female golden man, that&#8217;s why you have the mutants with the eight breasts, what do you think of that? what do ya make of this?, a litter of kids needs eight arms, turning people into animals, rats, subhumans, what do ya make of that?, he&#8217;s covered in fur, how does he put on pants?, he&#8217;s like a peacock, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpilosity"><strong>Hyperpilosity</strong> by L. Sprague de Camp</a>, why peahens choose peacocks with the longest tails, peahens want their male offspring to be attractive to peahens, they&#8217;re going to breed us out of business, <strong>The Turning Wheel</strong> (again), racism, H.P. Lovecraft, it&#8217;s an act!, there are mutants all around them, he&#8217;s one thing in the restaurant he&#8217;s another to the cop, a super-secret agency that everybody knows about and talks about, every family is hiding a mutant, FBI agents infiltrating anarchists groups, <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/atfs-milwaukee-sting-operation-marred-by-mistakes-failures-mu8akpj-188952581.html">ATF Operation Fearless</a>, Kafka by way of Dick, the NRA, welcome to America, Anita, sexism, nobody is clean in this fight, Cris ruins the horseshoe game (by way of saying goodbye?), a repulsive attractive powerful story, Cris&#8217; mom, Cris&#8217; dad, how could this story have been adapted otherwise, a stupid plot, why do the French want to blow up Los Angeles?, the movie is a train-wreck and yet&#8230;, Juliane Moore&#8217;s character is a monster, she&#8217;s driven, strapped to the <strong>Clockwork Orange</strong> chair watching CNN, that&#8217;s burying the lead, the two minute rule, he&#8217;s got no past, you have to have a past to decide what you&#8217;re going to do in the future, his present is our future, the movie has lots of problems, what was the &#8220;next&#8221; card, domestic rendition, there are <u>people</u>, don&#8217;t ask this question, Cris doesn&#8217;t need to speak because speaking is for planning, he&#8217;s just an animal, you have to have a past to plan.</p>
